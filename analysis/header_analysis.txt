Header Analysis

From: no-reply@access-accsecurity.com → Fake domain mimicking Microsoft.

Reply-To: solutionteamrecognizd03@gmail.com → Attacker’s personal email.

Return-Path: bounce@inlkrqa.co.uk → Different domain, not related to Microsoft.

SPF: none (no valid record found).

DKIM: none (no digital signature present).

DMARC: permerror (authentication policy failed).

Received Chain: shows mail relayed from IP 89.144.9.88, located in Europe, not owned by Microsoft.

X-Sender-IP: 89.144.9.88 → Unrecognized sending server.

Interpretation

This header clearly shows domain spoofing. The sender is pretending to be Microsoft but using unrelated servers and domains. None of the authentication checks pass (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), confirming the sender is unauthorized.

Additional Observations

The Reply-To Gmail address is a major red flag — corporations never use free mail providers for support.

The IP address used is linked to known spam or phishing activities, as verified through WHOIS and online blacklists.

Conclusion: The email is fraudulent and crafted to steal login credentials.
