Phishing Email Analysis Project
📘 Overview

This project aims to analyze and identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample. It helps build awareness about phishing tactics and enhances practical email threat analysis skills.

🎯 Objective

To detect phishing indicators in an email by examining its headers, sender details, body content, and links, then document findings in a clear report.

🧰 Tools Used

Email Client or saved email file (.txt, .eml)

Free Online Header Analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox)
